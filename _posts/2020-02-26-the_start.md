# The Start

In the mid 20-teens most if not all radiologists became "interested" in AI. Some interest was genuine academic interest. Some interest was intense fearfull interest. Some people's interest was the type you feel when you are really hoping a certain sports team that you hate loses so you can tell that one obnoxious co-worker who is a huge fan "I told you they weren't going to win the Super Bowl". As a radiology resident during that time period my interest was somewhere in the middle of those extremes. The technology sounded cool and fun, but I really hoped I wasn't about to lose the job that I did not yet even have to a computer. And, I'll admit, I kind of wanted it to fall flat. That way there would be alot of crow eating by the computer experts. The ones who knew nothing about the actual work done by radiologists, the work I was at the tail end of over a decade training to do. But even with their lack of knowledge in my field they were certain that computers could do the job way better then I could.

This initial vague interest in artificial intelligence in the realm of medical imaging only recently blossumed into the head-long vault into the field. Around Thanksgiving of 2020 a colleague of mine at the tele-cardiac imaging start-up I work for on the side, suggested that our little company should get acquainted with some of the medical AI companies. More than several had recently had well publicized multi-million-dollar funding rounds. We thought if we could meet with these like-minded entrepreneurs and find a way to bring them value then we may be able to increase our visibility and offer our imaging services to more potential patients.

I reached out to another old colleague, Ty Vachon, who had moved into the consulting world after many years as a radiologist and informaticist. He helped acquaint me with some of the basics (and I mean elementary school level basics) about machine learning, deep learning, and AI in medical imaging. I read his fantastic book, which I highly recommend, and came out the other side very excited about the prospects of where the future of deep learning and radiology where heading.

Ty suggested we collaborate on a sequel, and I very excitedly agreed (keep your eyes peeled, release date will be sometime in the Spring of 2021).

Over the next month I did in-depth research on many many AI companies with FDA approved or pending products. My understand of what was possible and what was being done started to coalesce and clarify. And my interest continued to grow. If you are in the healthcare AI space I highly recommend the Stanford AIMI Happy Hour talks that are on YouTube.

I also did the “Fundamentals of Machine Learning in Healthcare” course on Corusera. This is taught my Matt Lungren, a radiologist, and Serena Yeung, a computer scientist. That combination of instructor backgrounds made the course feel more approachable and digestible for a total neophyte, like myself.

Next, I wanted to take a swing at coding. I looked at several free tutorial videos on YouTube, but couldn't sink my teeth into anything in a meaningful way.

I found the Dataquest site (https://www.dataquest.io/) and I liked how I would be learning to use the coding in the general direction that I hoped to one day actually be using it. I have made it through about 20% of the curriculm, in about 2 months, and I have found that I am starting to feel almost kind of comfortable (I still have a long ways to go).

I also picked up the book "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch" by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. This was based on a recommendation by Curtis Langholtz on a Podcast interview he did with Paul Yi. That Podcast, "Radiology: Artificial Intelligence Podcast", is also really good and highly recommended for any working at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.

But the fastai book is why I am here. For anyone who has read it and/or done the course, as you know if Chapter 2 they highly recommend documenting your journey. 

In that spirt I set off here in the hopes that my expereince can answer some questions for those coming behind me (hard to imagine that right now since I am still pretty much in the starting blocks). But hopefully my trial and error will answer some questions for other novices groping their way through the dark.
