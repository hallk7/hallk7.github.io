## Machine Learning in the Dark
Hello. I am a radiologist and amateur data scientist. I came late to coding after catching the AI bug that was sweeping my medical specialty. I am hoping to learn to code so that I can speak somewhat intelligently to computer scientists. But I also want to learn how to tinker so I can work on little projects that I canâ€™t get anyone else excited enough about to build for me.

I am sharing my journey here in the hopes it can be of help to anyone following a similar path. But at the least, I hope it inspires people. Because if an almost middle aged doctor can learn the basics of deep learning, then probably anyone can.
